# Structural analyses

We predicted the protein structure models using [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold), which is based on MMseqs2 and AlphaFold2. 
Output protein models can be visualized using [PAE Viewer](https://pae-viewer.uni-goettingen.de/), or [ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/), or [Open source PyMol](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source).

For molecular dynamics simulation of predicted protein models, we used [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) and followed the standard instructions described in this [tutorial](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/index.html).
We employed tools like [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), [QtGrace](sourceforge.net/projects/qtgrace/), [open source PyMol](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source), and [TM-align](https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/) to analyze the simulation outputs.
